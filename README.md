# Guide to Plurality

Guide to Plurality is so far our biggest project, which aims to spread the knowledge about plurality â€“ presence of more than one consciousness in one mind, destigmatise it and fight for plural rights, such as right to be called a person, and also to provide resources to people struggling with dissociative identity disorder and other trauma related disorders. It started in june 2022, when we begun to write down our knowledge about the topic. In our free time we consistently researched and organised new informations while preparing the code for the website, which we uploaded on March 2023 and are still improving it regularly.

During this project, besides widening our understanding of various kinds of plurality, we learned how to use CSS features, like box and text shadows, to make our desing stand out.
