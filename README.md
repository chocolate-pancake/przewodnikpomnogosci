# Guide to Plurality

Guide to Plurality is so far our biggest project, which aims to spread the knowledge about plurality â€“ presence of more than one consciousness in one mind, destigmatise it and fight for plural rights, such as right to be called a person, and also to provide resources to people struggling with dissociative identity disorder and other trauma related disorders. It started in June 2022, when we begun to write down our knowledge about the topic. In our free time we consistently researched and organised new informations while preparing the code for the website, which we uploaded on March 2023 and are still improving it regularly.

During this project, besides widening our understanding of various kinds of plurality, we have learned how to use CSS features, like box and text shadows, to make our desing stand out. We have learned how to make our site responsive and accessible, we were testing its compatibility with a screen readers and added settings to enable users adjust the site to better fit their needs. We have learned more about HTML semantics, which enabled us to start using proper elements for specific purposes, like figure or blockquote. We have learned about the legal component of making websites and with that how to implement a Privacy Policy and Accessibility Declaration. And most importantly we have learned not to give up and keep on searching for solutions to problems that seem to be too difficult for us to solve.
